# The Leal Building
2 Miller Avenue, Mill Valley, CA 94941

## Building History

When the original Leal Building was erected in 1904, it became the tallest building in Mill Valley.  It was built by Harvey Klyce, a Mill Valley pioneer and building inspector, for Manuel Leal, the building’s owner.  It stood at the corner of Throckmorton and Miller Avenues, was three stories high, and was crowned with a cone-shaped tower.  Over the years, the Leal Building housed a variety of businesses, shops and residences, including Lockwood Pharmacy from 1906 to 1936, and Modern Bakery.  In June 1936, Leal sold the building to Mary Simpson Birnie.  In September 1936, she sold the building to Jacob Albert, president of Albert’s, Inc.  In December 1936, the building was razed to make way for a new structure that would house the new Albert’s department store. It would later become Mayer’s Department Store. In 2018, the ground floor houses Equator Coffee and Teas.

## Design Decisions (1920 Version)
- We decided to base all of our measurements off of the wooden model in the Mill Valley History Room.
- We had nothing to base color off of, so we looked at other buildings around it from the same time to get an idea of what colors it may be.
